What was your motivation?
    The motivation behind this Google Homepage project was to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS after going through
    the Free Code Camp web design coursework. Also to see how I would handle a project like this with basic familiarity 
    of HTML and CSS concepts. Lastly to have a project for portfolio to showcase my skills and understanding.
What did you learn?
    In this Google Homepage, project I learned the importance of planning out a webpage before jumping into the project. I also learned how to create a search bar, navigation bar , and footer while also learning how to align
    items and center items such as the search bar and logo image. This project also exposed to me that I needed to double down on learning the CSS Grid and Flexbox concepts due to how much it came up when designing the website
    with CSS. There were other concepts like CSS specificty, and class reuse within CSS that I also found cool and neat
    in terms of showing what could be done with CSS.
